## üí° Project Overview

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this assignment, we will architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## ‚ú® User Story

We can frame this challenge as follows:

```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

## ‚öì Minimum Requirements

- The command-line application should allow users to:

  - Add departments, roles, employees

  - View departments, roles, employees

  - Update employee roles

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Database Schema

- **department**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

- **role**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **title** - VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
  - **salary** - DECIMAL to hold role salary
  - **department_id** - INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

- **employee**:

  - **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  - **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  - **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  - **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  - **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager

## üì¶ Setup and Instructions:

- Ensure `Node.js` is installed on your machine. If `Node.js` is not installed on your machine, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install the application.
- The `package.json` file included in this repo already lists all Node modules, NPM packages, and other dependencies that are required to successfully run this application. Please be sure to run the `npm install` command within the _terminal, while in_ the root directory to install all required modules/packages.
- Use the `schema.sql` to create the database in [MySQL](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/).For assistance on how to install, creat and connect to [MySQL](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/) - simply click this link.
- (Optional) then run the `seed.sql` file to pre-populate your database. This will make the development and testing of individual features much easier. Check out [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) for some extra MySQL help.

- Next run `node employeeTracker.js` to start the application.

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

- Used the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

- Used [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

- Used [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

- You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

- You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.

## üî• Desired Future Enhancements

- The command-line application should allow users to:

  - Update employee managers

  - View employees by manager

  - Delete departments, roles, and employees

  - View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
